	Hello World
</div>

<!-- challenges - choose one or more of the following:

1. Let there be light!
Replace the material for the Earth with the one commented out in the code.
Add a spotlight or directional light to the scene so it can be seen.
Bonus points if you provide an eclipse for the people of this world :)

2. Make a satellite!
The "moon" revolves around the Earth, but it's jealous and wants a satellite of its own.
Give the moon a unique satellite that mimics the motion of the moon around the Earth.
Bonus points for adding a button to print out the satellite's position relative to the Earth.

3. Mayday, mayday!
Add a spaceship that flies through the scene (a cone is fine).
It should explode (go invisible) when it hits either the moon or the Earth.
Bonus points for making it autonomously avoid obstacles.
